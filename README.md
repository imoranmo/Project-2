A-LOTTA-RHYTHMS is an online social platform where music enthusiasts can connect with each other and create music together. 


## Experience:

Once a user signs up they will be able to choose their rhythm as we are calling it. Our rhythms consists of such things as looking for a band member,  wanting to learn an instrument, or looking for a place to play at. Users can view other users' posts(rhythms) and apply respond to the ones they are interested in. Users can also post their own rhythms for others to look at help with their music needs.
